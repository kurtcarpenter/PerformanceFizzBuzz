# PerformanceFizzBuzz

PerformanceFizzBuzz is a no-nonsense implementation of FizzBuzz. Inspired by solutions such as <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition">FizzBuzzEntepriseEdition</a>, this solution optimizes FizzBuzz for the highest degree of performance.

## Pillars of Quality

Apropos the maintenance of the highest standards of quality performance, PerformanceFizzBuzz uncompromisingly pursues the following guidelines:
* Ridiculous Speed
* Miniscule Memory Usage
* Excessive Scalability

By seeking to push the limits of these three ideas, PerformanceFizzBuzz can be run easily on low-end hardware, or run to "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" to seemingly limitless numbers on high-end computational powerhouses.

##FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a programming problem based off the popular children's game. While children of eight, seven, or even six years of age are easily able to play this game with unholy precision and accuracy, programmers are of a breed that find this game exceptionally challenging. Thusly, this game has become common as an interview question, where programmers of zero, intermediate, or even vast quantities of experience are forced into a new paradigm (and often tears) as they struggle to complete this trivial task. The basic rules are as follows:

Beginning at the numeral known as 1, and concluding at the large number known as 100, do the following:
* If divisible by 3, output "Fizz"
* If divisible by 5, output "Buzz"*
* If divisible by neither, output the number itself

*N.B. if the number is divisible by both 3 AND 5 (hard to imagine, many programmers struggle with this concept), e.g. 15, then output "FizzBuzz"

##FAQ 

**Why does this exist**

Too long has FizzBuzz labored under sub-optimal solutions; vast overhead and compromised performance should be regarded as unacceptable. PerformanceFizzBuzz seeks to bring the lost art of FizzBuzz to monumental heights of performance, pushing the boundaries of what we think we know is possible.

**Why C**

C is clearly the language of choice for any performance application. Java, Python, C#, and other mainstream languages simply do not provide the raw efficiency needed. For those of you who wish to write assembly, I salute you.
